# javascript_challenges
This repo includes different javascript challenges. It can help you to improve your javascript skills and develop your logical thinking


***
[alphabetposition.js](alphabetposition.js)
```
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it 
with its digits in descending order. Essentially, 
rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
```
***
[arraydif.js](arraydif.js)
```
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
```
***
[bitcounting.js](bitcounting.js)
```
Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. 
You can guarantee that input is non-negative.
```
***
[buggerpersistence.js](buggerpersistence.js)
```
Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
For example : 39 --> 3 (because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4 = 4 and 4 has only one digit)
```
***
[descendingorder.js](descendingorder.js)
```
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it 
with its digits in descending order. Essentially, 
rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.
```
***
[friendorfoe.js](friendorfoe.js)
```
Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.
If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...
```
***
[hashtaggenerator.js](hashtaggenerator.js)
```
The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.
Let's help them with our own Hashtag Generator!
Here's the deal:
It must start with a hashtag (#).
All words must have their first letter capitalized.
If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return false.
If the input or the result is an empty string it must return false.
```

[jadencasing.js](jadencasing.js)
```
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). 
Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always 
capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.
Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. 
The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.
```
***
[movingzeros.js](movingzeros.js)
```
Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.
```
***
[phonenumber.js](phonenumber.js)
```
Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), 
that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
Example : 
createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
```
***
[rgbtohex.js](rgbtohex.js)
```
Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), 
that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
Example : 
createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
```
***
[splitstrings.js](splitstrings.js)
```
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. 
If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing 
second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').
```
